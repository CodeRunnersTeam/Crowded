# Crowded

This is our app. Made for everyone who wants to avoid crowded places during this pandemic or in general.
The app is based on feedback given by users who report how crowded a place is. In the future we will implement a search function so that you can easly find the best place for you ;)


# Development

This app is made using the Flutter build engine and Dart programming language. This was a huge step for us cause we had to learn both the engine as well as the language in a very short amount of time during a hackaton (PoliHack)
